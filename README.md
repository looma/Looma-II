## Instructions for running Looma locally (Setup):

* Ensure you are on an amd64 or arm64 Mac or Linux machine
* Download, install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) so the Docker daemon is running

* `mkdir project-folder`
* `cd project-folder`
* `git clone https://github.com/looma/Looma-II`
* `cd Looma-II`

* In the project root (project-folder/Looma-II), run
* `./looma build` (Could take several minutes the first time)
    * This builds the two Docker images, loomaweb and loomadb
      
* In the project root, run
* `./looma run`
    * This runs docker-compose, and creates "loomaweb" and "loomadb" containers and runs them

If you get errors about docker authentication, run `docker logout`
    
* Navigate to [localhost:48080](http://localhost:48080) in your browser to use Looma
* Navigate to [localhost:47017](localhost:47017) to see that mongoDB is running

[MongoDB Compass (click to download)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/) is recommended for viewing the database.

### To get a terminal session in the container
```bash
% make shell
% docker exec -ti looma-web /bin/bash
```
